# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Next.js Development Server**
    This command starts the main application server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application will be running at http://localhost:9002.

3.  **Run the Genkit Development Server**
    In a separate terminal window, run this command to start the Genkit server for the AI functionalities.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```

You will need both servers running to use the application and its AI features.
